# Changelog

All notable changes to `strata-forge` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Changes accumulate under **Unreleased** as they merge
to `dev`; cutting a release renames that heading to the version and its date (see `CLAUDE.md`
§9b for what forces a release and which bump it takes).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Every runner spec (`RunSpec`, `FinetuneSpec`) carries `engine_version: str | None`, the engine
  the orchestrator validated the spec against. `load_config` refuses any other installed engine
  with `engine version mismatch`, read off the parsed JSON before the model validates any other
  field (so a stale machine is blamed even when the spec also carries a field it does not know).
  The version half must equal both the executing `strata_forge.__version__` and the version the
  installed distribution's metadata records; a `"<version>+<commit>"` value is accepted only when
  the installed distribution's PEP 610 `direct_url.json` records that exact full commit id (an
  index install or an editable checkout, which record none, cannot satisfy a commit claim, and a
  `+` followed by anything else is refused as malformed). A spec class that does not declare the
  field is a `TypeError`, so a runner cannot opt out. `strata_forge.pipelines.SPEC_VERSION`
  exports the value an orchestrator writes.
- `None` (no claim) is accepted as the transition for an orchestrator from before the handshake.
  It is removed, and a missing claim refused like any other mismatch, in the first minor release
  after every orchestrator that launches this engine stamps `engine_version`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-27

The release the handshake above compares against. Earlier history is in the git log.
